# Maersk Selenium Test Project

# <i> The task: </i> 
I was given a task to test the core functionality of a website using Java and Selenium.
I had to identify the main scenarios as well as the critical path, which is the main
function and purpose of the website. On top of that, finding any bugs and testing other components
of the site was a bonus. 

# <i> Prerequisites: </i>
In order to run this project You will need version 11 of IntelliJ as well as the latest version of chromedriver. 
There are also a few plugins that were required to do this project such as Cucumber for Java and
Gherkin. 

# <i> What I was able to do and what I would do better if I had more time: <i/>

I was able to identify the critical path which was selecting a departure city and a destination
as well as proceeding to choosing a flight option and reaching the part where the user has to 
complete a form and I managed to input all the details and proceed. Due to time constraints, I couldn't 
finish the task with maximum efficiency as my code could be cleaner and I could definitely write more tests.
